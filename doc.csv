1,"['Representational image\n\nAround 3,66,138 road accidents took place in India in 2020, causing 1,31,714 deaths. The figure was around 13 percent lower than the corresponding number for 2019, which saw 1,51,113 deaths due to road accidents in India, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said in a written response in Lok Sabha on August 5.\n\nOne must note here, one of the reasons behind the sharp decrease in the number of road accidents in 2020 was partially due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, which forced the entire nation into months of strict lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. During this time, the movement of vehicles -- commercial and private -- was highly regulated.\n\nGiving further details on road accidents in India, the Road Transport Minister informed the Lok Sabha that Tamil Nadu recorded the highest number of road accidents followed by West Bengal and Karnataka.\n\nHe added that road accidents in India occur mainly due to speeding, drunken driving, driving on the wrong side, lane indiscipline, use of mobile phones while driving, mechanical defect, faulty vehicle, bad roads, bad weather, and lack of knowledge on road signage.\n\nGadkari pointed out that now road safety has been made an integral part of road design at the planning stage.\n\n""The ministry has delegated powers to regional officers of MoRTH for technical approval of the detailed estimates for rectification of identified road accident black spots,"" he said.\n\nWhile addressing the issue, Gadkari also said that his ministry has devised a multi-pronged strategy to address the road safety issues. The strategy will focus on education, road engineering, vehicle engineering, enforcement, and emergency care.\n\nTo minimise the number of road accidents, the Government of India has also imposed stricter punitive measures for violations of traffic rules under the new amended Motor Vehicles Act.']"

This check will be done by the officials of the petrol pumps. Petrol will only be provided to the riders of the two wheelers who are wearing a helmet.\n\nBusiness is our purpose, such rules cannot be followed:\n\nAn official named Mr. Sunit Bagai of the Rajasthan Petroleum Dealer Association has been recently heard quoting that petrol pumps are business establishments.\n\nSuch business establishments cannot revolve around laws like the one that has been applied by the West Bengal government.\n\nIn addition to this, Mr. Sunit Bagai was also heard adding that petrol pumps cannot be forced to follow this rule in lending of petrol to its customers.\n\nWays that have been thought of to trim down the rising accidental cases of two wheelers on the road are:\n\nSuggestion I:\n\nThe first measure is to implement the rule that has been implemented by the government of West Bengal.\n\nThe rule simply states that petrol must only be given to the rider of a two wheeler vehicle when he is wearing a helmet. In any case otherwise, provision of petrol must not be made to the rider.\n\nIf there is a pillion rider too on the two wheeler vehicle, then the pillion rider must also be wearing a helmet in addition to the main rider.\n\nPetrol under no circumstance should be provided by the staff of the petrol pump to a person who is not outfitted in a helmet.\n\nSuggestion II:\n\nWhen the traffic police generate and charge a challan for an individual while he is caught red handed in driving without a helmet, in greater part of such cases, the person who has been charged of such challan rides his vehicle throughout the day without a helmet.\n\nIt may be brought to the notice that a person cannot be charged twice in a single day by the traffic police on account of challan. Once a person has been charged of a challan, he cannot be charged again.\n\nIn light of the above rule, once a person has been charged, the person is free and yet rides without a helmet all day long.\n\nTo curb such practices, it has been suggested that the traffic police not only charge the individual of a challan, but also provide the defaulter with a helmet after charging them with the challan\n\nA brief summary of the accidents followed by the injury or death caused to an individual; is stated for a period of three recent years:\n\nYear Accident Death Injured 2013 2908 783 2634 2014 3085 844 2793 2015 3000 850 2700\n\nData pertaining to the different petrol pumps and the number of their establishments in Jaipur:\n\nPetrol Pump Numbers of it established in the city of Jaipur IOCL - Indian Oil Corporation 42 HPCL - Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited 45 BPCL - Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited 33 Reliance Petroleum 02\n\nConditions prevailing in the state: An insight into state traffic and petrol data']"

But we are shocked at the rates being offered to us,” said Gora Singh Bhainibagha, a farmer who grows capsicum on 5 acres of land in Mansa’s Bhainibagha village, referring to Mann’s plea to farmers to opt for crop diversification.\n\n© Provided by The Indian Express capsicum prices Authorities said that they have been imparting training to farmers to store the produce in cold stores and sell it when the prices are appropriate. (Express)\n\n“This time, just at the beginning of the season, rates have crashed. We pack one polybag of about 15-17 kg which traders pick from us. This time, we are only being offered Rs 15 for a bag. For a 17 kg bag, the rate is less than a rupee for 1 kg of capsicum,” Bhainibagha, who is with the Punjab Kisan Union, said.\n\nIn Punjab, vegetables are cultivated on more than 3 lakh hectares of land. Of these, capsicum is mainly grown in the Mansa, Ferozepur and Sangrur districts on an area of around 1,500 hectares – 500 hectares in Sangrur, 250 hectares in Mansa, around 100 hectares in Ferozepur and the rest in various districts, the horticulture department said.\n\nThis year, Punjab is witnessing a glut in capsicum. The extended cold weather has meant that the production of capsicum was more in all the states this year, the horticulture department said. Earlier, the crop from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh used to come in the January-February period, followed by Punjab’s produce by March end or beginning of April. “This time, the variety from all states has come together…due to which Punjab farmers are facing a glut of capsicum. Climate change seems to be the reason for this glut as in the past, the Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh crop used to arrive early,” Punjab Horticulture Director Shailender Kaur explained to The Indian Express.\n\nMeanwhile |Punjab: 4 including 2 from Rajasthan held with Rs 15.05 lakh in fake currency\n\nBhainibagha said farmers faced a similar problem during the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. “Marriage functions were limited, social gatherings had reduced and even hotels and restaurants remained closed for a large part of the year. But even then, we had got reasonable rates of Rs 10-15 a kg for our early crop in April. By May, rates had reduced to just Rs 3 per kg,” he added.\n\nThe following years, 2021 and 2022, were good for the crop with farmers even getting up to Rs 20 a kg for a few varieties.\n\nJaspal Singh, a farmer who grows capsicum on 8 acres of land, said Mansa is one of the main markets for capsicum in the state. “Traders from West Bengal or Kashmir come directly to our farms to pick the produce. Some produce is sold in Azadpur Mandi in Delhi and in the local market. But the outside customer is missing, so we are facing a glut this time,” he added.\n\nAuthorities said that they have been imparting training to farmers to store the produce in cold stores and sell it when the prices are appropriate.\n\nHowever, Sukhdev Singh from Mansa’s Kotli Kalan village is regretting his decision to grow capsicum on 3 acres of his land. Though the Punjab government had opened a chilli cluster in Ferozepur district, there is no plan yet to bail out farmers. “This is the reason that farmers don’t want to come out of the wheat-paddy cycle,” Bhainibagha added.\n\nReeling under losses, farmers, who spend around Rs 1 lakh an acre on capsicum, are now seeking help from the Punjab government so that they can go to Kolkata to sell their produce. However, the government is yet to comment on the matter.']"
